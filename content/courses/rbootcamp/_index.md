These are the materials from the 2019 R Bootcamp for incoming graduate students for the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon. If you'd like to use these resources in teaching, I recommend forking the [github repository](https://github.com/coryc3133/uoregon_r_bootcamp). You can also work through the materials on your own by cloning the repo, and working throughthe files labelled "r_bootcamp_day_1.Rmd", "r_bootcamp_day_2.Rmd", and "r_bootcamp_day_3.Rmd". You can check your work with the "*_with_answers.Rmd" versions of those files.

You can also walk through the rendered versions of these Rmds here.
