The Life and Time project is an NSF-funded project run by Gerard Saucier and Sanjay Srivastava (NSF Grant # 0921842). It is a 4-year study and follows an accelerated longitudinal design. I have worked with this data to examine change and stability in the Big Six and other constructs across the adult lifespan.
