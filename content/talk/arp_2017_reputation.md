abstract = "Reputations often extend beyond people who have met, communicated to strangers through gossip and hearsay. We present results from 264 participants in a novel laboratory paradigm for studying consensus and accuracy of hearsay reputations. Two participants spent 15 minutes getting to know one another (P1/target). Then each of them (P1) told a naïve participant (P2) about the person they met (target). Participants rated themselves and the target on the Big 6 personality domains. We found evidence of consensus in hearsay reputations: impressions formed by the P1 and P2 about the target were moderately correlated (r's from .20 to .54). For some traits, hearsay consensus was greater than direct observers' accuracy, suggesting that hearsay can form a consistent but wrong reputation. We found limited evidence of hearsay accuracy: P2 impressions and target's self-reports correlated most strongly for Extraversion (r = .25). We discuss implications for how reputations propagate through social networks."
