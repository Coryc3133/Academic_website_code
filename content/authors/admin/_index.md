His research interests include **Personality** (*who we are*), **Interpersonal Perception** (*what people think about us*), **Reputations** (*what people say and hear about us*), how these are manifest in online environments, and the extent to which they're recoverable from digital footprints.

His methodological interests include social network analysis, predictive modelling / machine learning, text analysis, structural equation modelling, hierarchical linear modelling.
