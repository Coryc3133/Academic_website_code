I am Psychological Scientist by training, currently working as a Predictive Modeler at FCCI Insurance Group, where I use my expertise in statistics, machine learning, and behavioral science to contribute to FCCI's goals to write profitable business. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow in the [Emotion and Self-Control Lab](http://selfcontrol.psych.lsa.umich.edu/) (PI: Ethan Kross) at University of Michigan's Department of Psychology. Prior to that, I was a PhD student in the [Personality and Social Dynamics Lab](https://psdlab.uoregon.edu/) (PI: Sanjay Srivastava) at the University of Oregon's Department of Psychology. I spent my time in academics learning to apply complex data analytic techniques - social network analysis, predictive modelling / machine learning, text analysis, structural equation modelling, hierarchical linear modelling - to answer questions about personality, emotion, and reputation.
